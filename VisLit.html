			<h3 class='subheadings'>HOW ACCESSIBLE IS EDUCATION TO BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED?</h3>
			<p class='subcontent'>
			Education across all levels needs to be inclusive of students with all sorts of abilities and backgrounds. Students with visual impairments have often been underserved in the design of educational technologies. To combat this, many researchers and professionals have identified the need to translate visual stimuli for theoretical advancement in general education and the sciences even more explicitly. There have been more blind and visually impaired students in schools, which requires teachers to make their lessons more accessible. Since much of chemistry is visual, it is a particularly challenging subject to teach. Learning and using the periodic table is one of the most vital aspects of chemistry and is highly reliant on visual depictions.</p> 
			<h3 class='subheadings'>HOW THIS PROJECT HELPS?</h3>
			<p class='subcontent'>
			The project demonstrates a novel design to effectively communicate the immense amount of information that is embedded in the visual structure of the periodic table. Our technique focuses on mapping these visual variables of the table to tactile variables that visually impaired students can more easily perceive and learn.
			</p>
			<h3 class='subheadings'>PROTOTYPE-DESIGN</h3>
			<p class='subcontent'>The primary concept of our prototype relies on the theory of constructionism. The prototype allows visually impaired students to construct the periodic table on their own. It is made up of two components -Firstly, each element on the periodic table is represented by its own piece. Each element in the periodic table has several characteristics associated with it, which are typically represented in visual ways. Therefore, it was essential for us to define characteristics to map a data dimension (which are typically visual in the commonly known periodic tables) to a display dimension (which should incorporate tactile variables that a visually impaired student would be able to identify). In a periodic table, colors usually denote ten different types of elements, and we have defined shapes of the element pieces to indicate that, such that:
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen is a Sphere</li>
<li>Alkali Metals are triangles</li>
<li>Alkaline Earth Metals are Diamonds</li>
<li>Transition Metals are Square</li>
<li>Basic Metals (Post-Transition) are Pentagons</li>
<li>Semimetals (Metalloid) are Semi Circles</li>
<li>Non-Metals are Ovals</li>
<li>Halogens are Circles</li>
<li>Noble Gases are Trefoils</li>
<li>Lanthanides are Stars</li>
<li>Actinides are Ribbons</li></ul>
<p class='subcontent'>
We chose shapes with sharp corners and edges for metals, while for nonmetals, we chose shapes with rounded edges.These element blocks also have a stick attached to it, such as a popsicle or lollipop. The length and the diameter of these sticks denote the row and column the element resides in.There are seven rows or periods in total, so the diameter of the stick increases as you move from top to bottom down the periodic table.There are 18 columns in the periodic table, and each column has a specific elevation, or length, associated with it, which increases as you move from left to right across the table.Most importantly, to allow the learner to identify these pieces as individual elements, we will have the symbol and an atomic number of the element on the shape of the block in braille. <br/>

The second part of the prototype is the box. The top of the box has the layout of the periodic table drawn on it. The boundaries of the table are made of raised strips for the user in order to be able to make a clear distinction between rows and columns.The board also has holes of different diameters in each element's space. The stick of the element piece can be inserted into its corresponding hole.The inside of the box also has steps of different sizes so that when the user inserts the element piece, they will get feedback from the base of the box on whether it is the correct length for that space, and therefore, if the element piece is in the correct spot.

				<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
				<p>Storyboarding helped us understand and define the possible context in which the periodic table will be used and audience who uses it. <br/>Audience: visually impaired (BVI) middle to high school level students who are learning chemistry<br/>
				Context: Our design focuses on stdents who are using the table to start learning about the structure of the table and also who are using it to find specific information from the table to to assist them in more complex calculations or reactions.<br> <img src='storyboarding.jpg' width='50%' style='overflow:hidden;display:block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;'/></p>

				<h3>User Testing</h3> We conducted some simple user studies by blindfolding sighted users to get a basic feedback on our design.From user testing and implementation, we were able to get a better idea of how well the user identifies the pieces and constructs the table overall. We defined and conducted a few simple activities around the individual piece differentiation test, most of the users where able to easily distinguish the pieces using their shape, length and width.We also conducted a collaborative activity where the users collaboratively constructed the table using all the pieces. During the study we understood some of the shortcomings of the design from the user feedback, and understood several improvements that could be made to this iteration of the project.<br>

			<p class='subcontent'>Overall, the project helped us understand the importance of providing accessible tools and interfaces for the disabled population that is usually underserved.</p>
			<h3 class='subheadings'><br/>Future Work Plans</h3>
			<p class='subcontent'>We plan to contimue on the project and solve the shortcomings of the design by converting the board to a smartboard by adding sensors so that users can obtain more intuitive, iteractive feedback, about the current position and how many steps to get to the element position they are looking for.</p>
